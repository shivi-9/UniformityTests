# Uniformity Tests
The aim of this assignment is to implement a uniformity test and apply it in two scenarios. The uniformity test is basically used to determine whether a given set of samples is uniformly distributed or not.

# Requirements
The code was written in Python 3.7.

# Usage
There are two ways to run this code. Either you can simple open the jupyter notebook and click on Run All cells (SUGGESTED WAY) or you can follow these steps to create a .py version of this notebook:

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook file is located.
Install nbconvert if you haven't already done so by running the command
```
pip install nbconvert 
```
Run the following command to convert your .ipynb file to a Python script:
```
jupyter nbconvert --to script your_notebook.ipynb
```
This command will create a Python script with the same name as your Jupyter Notebook file, but with a .py extension. 4. Run the Python script by running the following command:

```
python Code.py
```
This will run all the cells in the Jupyter Notebook file.
